Hello world. This is Kent Charlemagne Jr.'s first foray into coding and using VSC. 
I have been eagerly awaiting the day I could start to use the text editor in TOP's course, but I have remained diligent and have not rushed myself. I have already learned so much and I am hungry for more. 
Future me, if you ever open this file again, just know that you can freaking do this. You can learn to code. You can get a job without a degree. A piece of paper does not define you. 
You are intelligent and persistent and you will make it. You will be a developer by APril 2025. Trust in yourself.
